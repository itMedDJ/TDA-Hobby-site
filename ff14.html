          That is a good question. to sum it up becuase im new and havent done
          much of the story. you are the warrior of light and becuase of that
          you are the realms only hope in stopping the bad dudes from being bad
          dudes. as you play the game you unlock new jobs (this games version of
          classes) and they vary wildly in what they can do.

          The info i have on the gameplay is going to be super limited as i
          havent really played enough to have experienced it. that being said
          what i have played is awesome. the gameplay is very reminiscent of
          games like wow but with a JRPG twist that im sure fans of either
          franchise will love. the battles range from this is okay to, why does
          the floor hate me, which is rather engaging because the game tells you
          where the bad part to stand is and then you will have reposition or
          your healer calls you names. the one thing that stands out in final
          fantasy 14 however is the comunity of players, i have never been apart
          of a gaming comunity this friendly ever, as a new player other players
          where so kind and under standing that you were new that they just
          helped and quested with you not because they got anything from it but
          because they wanted to my free company are also some of the nicest
          people ever and in the first 10 mins of being in it they queued raids
          and dugeons with me just to helo the queue timer which would never
          happen in other titles.

        <h1 class="text-center text-xl font-bold">The classes</h1>
        <p class="pb-6 pr-6 pl-6 mt-6 text-lg">
          This game has 19 different classes for the player to choose from.
          these classes fit into a sublass of either the tank, healer, melee
          dps, ranged dps or caster dps. because of the amount of classes in the
          game im just going to talk about the ones i have actually played.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-center text-lg font-bold">The red mage</h2>
        <p class="pb-6 pr-6 pl-6 mt-6 text-lg">
          The red mage was the second class i picked up and let me tell you, it
          is so much fun. the red mages gimick is something called dual cast.
          what this does is when you cast a spell you get to cast another one
          with zero cool down so the gameplay loop is cast a short cool down and
          then a long one with no charge. on top of this you have two mana bars
          to track. the black and white mana bars fill when you cast certain
          spells and once you have a certain ammount you can use melee combos.

        <h2 class="text-center text-lg font-bold">The gunbreaker</h2>
        <p class="pb-6 pr-6 pl-6 mt-6 text-lg">
          The gunbreaker is a tank that moonlights as a dps. they excel at good
          damage and good self healing. there main mechanic is there weapon
          charges that you obtain through certain combos. once obtained you can
          use them to pull off high damage combos that are really quite flashy
          for a tank. the gunbreaker is my favourite tank in the game to play
          and may be my favourite class in general.
